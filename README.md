#### Introduction
With no memory of who you are try to find out about yourself. Cruise through the outlands as you
try to find out who you are and build a reputation for yourself.


#### Regions
The game is divided into 4 districts/regions. When the player moves between districts enemies are stronger and foes plenty in number.

DISTRICT                       |    BRIEFING
-------------------------------|-----------------------------
Small Town District| Easy going neighbours. Few enemies. 
Heung Long Zi District| District plagued by melee weapons and fighters. Villagers are fewer in numbers here.
Tskonge District| High powered guns and ammunition. Drugs run everything here. 
Labyrinthine District| Well... no one who reached here came back to tell the tale.
