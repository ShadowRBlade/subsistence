"Hey Cobble, I think it's time for us to scrap this place. Turn it into a good bunker."
"Ha Yeah."
"Jay, let's salvage before we decide to tear down any of this rubbish."
"Get into the attic. Check it out."

Jay moves into the attic of the dilapidated house.

Switching on the flashlight he carried along with him he looks all around the attic of the house.
Moving about he comes across a cupboard which due to age has given way revealing an underground room.

"Cobble get in here ! I guess I found somethin'"

Cobble looks at Jay whose focus hasn't yet shifted from the cupboard.

"Why don't you pull it aside?"

"Ok, Let's move it."

They move the cupboard to move into the underground room, and try to find a light switch
to illuminate the room.

Jay finds it.

He pulls the chain that hangs from the ceiling the light flickers, and a yellow glow
finally illuminates the room.

What they see was what they had never thought they would to see.
